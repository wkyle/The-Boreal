When writing XML documents I've chosen to use PascalCase for tag names:

<TagName></TagName>

and PascalCase for attributes:

<TagName attributeName=""></TagName>

This is a commonly found naming convention and I like how it reads with the heirarchy of uppercase first word and lowercase first word.

Acronyms like FED (Federal Electoral District) will be left in uppercase and pluralized with a lowercase "s", i.e., FEDs
